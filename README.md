- 👋 Hi, I’m @batknuckles
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to become skilled at SQL as a non-programmer in my professional life. So I want to focuse on the most useful queries and basic troubleshooting. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL foundations and in time I want to become an advanced user of this coding language. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on SQL projects involving publically available data sets. 
- 📫 How to reach me is simple. Right here on this site. 
- 😄 Pronouns: Don't ask
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like learning new skills.
